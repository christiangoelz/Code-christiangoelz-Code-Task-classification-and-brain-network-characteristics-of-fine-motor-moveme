# Paper: Classification of visuomotor tasks based on electroencephalographic data depends on age-related differences in brain activity patterns

This repository contains the code to generate results, summary statistics, and raw figures for the manuscript "Classification of visuomotor tasks based on electroencephalographic data depends on age-related differences in brain activity patterns"

## Code dependencies: 
Code was developed in Anaconda in the following environment: eeg.yml

## Recomputation
- To recompute the results run _main.py_ after setting the directory path in line 34-37 to the input (i.e. where the raw data is located) and output path (i.e. where you want to store the results).
- To generate the figures run the scripts corresponding to the figures name after setting the input path to the  output directory containing the results generated with _main.py_.
